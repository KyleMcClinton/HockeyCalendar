# Hockey Calendar

An app I made to learn C# / Xamarin forms.  Uses the National Hockey League API to display the schedule of games for selected teams.

Builds for Android (tested in Android Emulator - Pixel 2 Pie 9.0) and UWP.

## Build / Installation

The app should be built using the included Visual Studio Solution file.  To run the app, either UWP must be set to Developer Mode or Android Emulator must be available.

## TODO
* Mostly have been working on Android version.  UWP executable has some visual bugs.
* Display team logos from **https://www-league.nhlstatic.com/images/logos/teams-current-primary-light/TEAMID.svg**
* Allow user to specify a date range they are interested in, currently we only show the next two weeks of games.
